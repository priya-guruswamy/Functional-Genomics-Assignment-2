# Functional-Genomics-Assignment-2
This assignment involves differential expression analysis and pathway analysis for single-cell RNA sequencing data. I identified significant genes and explored their involvement in biological pathways. 

The first step filtered genes expressed in at least 5% of cells. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to find differentially expressed genes based on treatment. I created a coefficient table and generated a volcano plot to show the relationship between effect size and statistical significance.

I analyzed treatments with significant gene expression changes using strict cutoffs. An UpSet plot was created to study overlaps between gene sets for different treatments. The Reactome Pathway Browser was used to identify pathways linked to the top 100 upregulated and downregulated genes. 

Conceptual questions explored identifying rare genetic disorder mutations and studying chromatin interactions.
